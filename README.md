These programs are available in this repository:

* VariationalHO.py [Python]
* Random.py [Python]

# Utilization

The usage of two separate plotting libraries necessitates independent download, setup, and installation by users.

* matplotlib (python)
* numpy       (pyhon)

# Example usage

* matplotlib (python)

The python files `VariationalH.py` and `Random.py` can be run from the terminal by typing:

`<> python VariationalH.py`

`<> python Random.py`

This requires a working `Python` distribution (so that the python executable exists) with the Python package `numpy` and `Matplotlib` also installed.
